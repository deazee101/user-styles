# User Styles

Here some user-styles to customize your beloved websites.


## Twitter (wide)

This makes tweets more wide. For every tweet, the different types of information are spread horizontally so that it's easer to scan the timeline from top to bottom.

[Get the styles](twitter-wide.css)


### How to install

1. Install one of those "user-styles" browser extensions, like [User CSS](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/user-css/okpjlejfhacmgjkmknjhadmkdbcldfcb) for Chrome.
2. Click on the "Get the styles" link above that you want to use, then copy the CSS styles.
3. Go to the appropriate site, for example [twitter.com](https://twitter.com/) if you want to use "Twitter (wide)", open the extension and paste the copied CSS styles.
4. Done! It should look somewhat close to the screenshot above.


### Some notes:

- Only tested in Chrome. But should still work in other browsers too.
- The styles might break if the site changes the class names.
