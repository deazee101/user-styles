# User Styles

Here some user-styles to customize your beloved websites.


## Twitter

[Get the styles](twitter.css)

This hides all the meta information and only shows the essential content. You can still [hover each tweet](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/378023/21449668/1173df8e-c933-11e6-8faa-d17d6402a2e4.gif) to see the meta information or access other actions.

### How to install

1. Install one of those "user-styles" browser extensions, like [User CSS](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/user-css/okpjlejfhacmgjkmknjhadmkdbcldfcb) for Chrome.
2. Click on the "Get the styles" link above and copy the CSS styles.
3. Go to the appropriate site, for example [twitter.com](https://twitter.com/) if you want to use "Twitter", open the extension and paste the copied CSS styles.
4. Done! It should look somewhat close to the screenshot.


### Some notes:

- Only tested in Chrome. But should still work in other browsers too.
- There are probably a few bugs or inconsistencies.
- The styles might break if the site changes the class names.
